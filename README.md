# Emotion Classifier

This is a rudimentary realtime Emotion Detector and classifier buid using #Keras and #OpenCV library.
Kaggle Facial Expression dataset Fer2013.csv is used to train the model. The accuracy it provides is 62.5%
and there are still some minor bugs like #Disgust emotion is not classified properly sometimes.
